Open CASCADE Technology
=======================

This directory contains sources of Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), a collection
of C++ libraries providing services for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD data
exchange, and visualization. OCCT can be best applied in development of
software dealing with 3D modeling (CAD), manufacturing / measuring (CAM) or
numerical simulation (CAE).

Packaging
---------

You can receive certified version of OCCT code in different packages.

- Snapshot of Git repository: contains only bare sources of OCCT; many C++ 
  files, HTML documentation, and project files / makefiles for building OCCT
  need to be generated.

- Complete source archive: contains all sources of OCCT, including C++ files
  generated by WOK, HTML and PDF documentation, and projects / makefiles for 
  building on all officially supported platforms.

- Binary package (platform-specific): in addition to complete source archive, 
  includes binaries of OCCT and third-party libraries built on one platform. 
  This package allows using OCCT immediately after installation.

Certified versions of OCCT can be downloaded from http://www.opencascade.org

You can also find OCCT pre-installed on your system, or install it from 
packages provided by a third party. Note that packaging and functionality
of such versions can be different from certified releases. Please consult 
documentation accompanyog your version for details.

Documentation
-------------

Open file doc/html/index.html to browse HTML documentation.

If HTML documentation is not available in your package, you can:

- Generate it from sources. 
  You need to have Tcl and Doxygen 1.8.4 (or above) in PATH.
  In Tcl prompt, cd to OCCT root folder and run "source dox/start.tcl".
  On Windows you can also run shortcut batch file *gendoc.bat*.

- Read documentation in source plain text (MarkDown) format found in 
  subfolder *dox*

See *dox/dev_guides/documentation/documentation.md* for details.

Building
--------

In most cases you need to rebuild OCCT on your platform (OS, compiler) before
using it in your project, to ensure binary compatibility.

Consult the file *dox/dev_guides/building/building.md* for instructions on
building OCCT from sources on supported platforms.

Version
-------

The current version of OCCT can be consulted in the file
*src/Standard/Standard_Version.hxx*
